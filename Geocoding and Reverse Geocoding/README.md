### Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding 

#### This script takes an address and return its latitude and longitude.This process is called geocoding
#### It can also perform the opposite operation that is take latitude, longitude and provide address.

#### I have used the LocationIQ website's geocoding api inorder to solve this problem.

#### For the purpose of this script I obtained a private token to access the api using a dummy account so you can use my private token.

#### To obtain your own private token create a *free account* at https://locationiq.com/ and replace my private token with yours.(Optional)

#### Remember, *don't share* your private token with anyone if you use your personal email for account creation.
